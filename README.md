# Crossplane Provider for InfluxDB

## Overview

This `provider-influxdb` repository is the Crossplane infrastructure provider for
[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com). The provider that is built from the
source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane
and adds the following new functionality:

* Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model InfluxDB Cloud infrastructure and 
  services.
* Controllers to provision these resources in InfluxDB Cloud based on the users desired
  state captured in CRDs they create
